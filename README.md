# SplitsGenerator
- This is a script that generates splits to copy into LiveSplit. Python is required.
- Simply double click generate_from_input.py or drag this py file onto the bat file to run it while seeing errors.

## Adjust these options in generate_from_input.py
USE_SUBSPLITS = True</br>
USE_STAR_COUNTS = True</br>
SWAP_STAR_AND_LEVEL_SYMBOL = False</br>
STAR_COUNT_IN_FRONT = False</br>

## Copy from sheets
Copy directly from google sheets into the input.txt file. (It will include tabs which are used by the script as a separator.)

If using subsplits, use 3 columns. If not, use 2
