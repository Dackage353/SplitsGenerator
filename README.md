# SplitsGenerator
a script that generates splits that you can paste into LiveSplit. Python is required. Simply double click generate_from_input.py or drag that py file onto the bat file to run it while seeing errors.

## Adjust these options in generate_from_input.py
USE_SUBSPLITS = True
SWAP_STAR_AND_LEVEL_SYMBOL = True
STAR_COUNT_IN_FRONT = True

## Copy from sheets
Copy directly from google sheets. It will include tabs. Tabs are used by the script as a separator

If using subsplits, use 3 columns. If not, use 2
